                    LaTeX (pronounced LAY-tek or LAH-tek) is a tool used to create professional-looking documents. It is based on the WYSIWYM (what you see is what you mean) idea, meaning you only have focus on the contents of your document and the computer will take care
                    of the formatting. Instead of spacing out text on a page to control formatting, as with Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer, users can enter plain text and let LaTeX take care of the rest.

                    LaTeX is used all over the world for scientific documents, books, as well as many other forms of publishing. Not only can it create beautiful typesetted documents, but it allows users to very quickly tackle the more complicated parts of typesetting, such
                    as inputting mathematics, creating tables of contents, referencing and creating bibliographies, and having a consistent layout across all sections. Due to the huge number of open source packages available (more on this later), the
                    possibilities with LaTeX are endless. These packages allow users to do even more with LaTeX, such as add footnotes, draw schematics, create tables etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the most important reasons people use LaTeX is that it separates the content of the document from the style. This means that once you have written the content of your document, we can change its appearance with ease. Similarly, you can create one
                    style of document which can be used to standardise the appearance of many different documents. This allows scientific journals to create templates for submissions. These templates have a pre-made layout meaning that only the content
                    needs to be added. In fact there are hundreds of templates available for everything from CVs to slideshows.

                    The first step is to create a new LaTeX project. You can do this on your own computer by creating a new .tex file, or else you can start a new project in ShareLaTeX. Let's start with the simplest working example:
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>
                            <ul>
                                <li>\documentclass{article}</li>
                                <li>\begin{document}</li>
                                <li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            First document. This is a simple example, with no
                                        extra parameters or packages included.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                 </li>
                                <li>\end{document}</li>
                            </ul>
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>
                    You can see that LaTeX has already taken care of the first piece of formatting for you, by indenting the first line of the paragraph. Let's have a close look at what each part of our code does.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first line of code declares the type of document, known as the class. The class controls the overall appearance of the document. Different types of documents will require different classes i.e. a CV/resume will require a different class than a scientific
                    paper. In this case, the class is <b>article</b>, the simplest and most common LaTeX class. Other types of documents you may be working on may require different classes such as <b>book</b> or <b>report</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After this, you write the content of our document, enclosed inside the <b>\begin{document}</b> and <b>\end{document}</b> tags. This is known as the body of the document. You can start writing here and make changes to the text if you
                    wish. To see the result of these changes in the PDF you have to compile the document. To do this in ShareLaTeX, simply hit <b>Recompile</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are using a basic text editor such as gedit, emacs, vim, sublime, notepad etc., you will have to compile the document manually. To do this, simply run <b>pdflatex &ltyour document&gt&lt&#47your&gt</b> in your computers terminal/command
                    line. See <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Basics#Compilation" target="_blank">here</a> for more information on how to do this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are using a dedicated LaTeX editor such as TeXmaker or TeXworks, simply hit the <b>Recompile</b> button. Consult the programs documentation if you are unsure of where this is.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now that you have learnt how to add content to our document, the next step is to give it a title. To do this, we must talk briefly about the <b>preamble</b>.
                </p>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="The_preamble_of_a_document">
            <header>
                <h1>The preamble of a document</h1>
            </header>
            <article>
                <p>In the previous example the text was entered after the <b>\begin{document}</b> command. Everything in your <b>.tex</b> file <i>before</i> this point is called the <b>preamble</b>. In the preamble you define the type of document you are
                    writing, the language you are writing in, the packages you would like to use (more on this later) and several other elements. For instance, a normal document preamble would look like this:
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>
                        <ul>
                            <li>\documentclass[12pt, letterpaper]{article}</li>
                            <li>\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}</li>
                        </ul>
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Below a detailed description of each line:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>\documentclass[12pt, letterpaper]{article}</b> As said before, this defines the type of document. Some additional parameters included in the square brackets brackets can be passed to the command. These parameters must be comma-separated.
                    In the example, the extra parameters set the font size (<b>12pt</b>) and the paper size (<b>letterpaper</b>). Of course other font sizes (<b>9pt, 11pt, 12pt</b>) can be used, but if none is specified, the default size is <b>10pt</b>.
                    As for the paper size other possible values are <b>a4paper</b> and <b>legalpaper</b>; see the article about Page size and margins for more details about this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}</b> This is the encoding for the document. It can be omitted or changed to another encoding but utf-8 is recommended. Unless you specifically need another encoding, or if you are unsure about it, add
                    this line to the preamble.
                </p>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Adding_a_title_author_and_date">
            <header>
                <h1>Adding a title, author and date</h1>
            </header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    To add a title, author and date to our document, you must add three lines to the <b>preamble</b> (NOT the main body of the document). These lines are
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>\title{First document}</b> <br> This is the title.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>\author{Hubert Farnsworth}</b> <br> Here you put the name of the Author(s) and, as a optional parameter, you can add the next command:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>\thanks{funded by the ShareLaTeX team}</b> <br> This can be added after the name of the autor, inside the braces of the title command. It will add a superscript and a footnote with the text inside the braces. Useful if you need
                    to thank an institution in your article.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>\date{February 2014}</b> <br> You can enter the date manually or use the command \today so the date will be updated automatically at the time you compile your document
                </p>
                <p>
                    With these lines added, your preamble should look something like this
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>
                        <ul>
                            <li>\documentclass[12pt, letterpaper, twoside]{article}</li>
                            <li>\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}</li>
                            <li>
                                    \title{First document}</li>
                            <li>\author{Hubert Farnsworth \thanks{funded by the ShareLaTeX team}}</li>
                            <li>\date{February 2017}</li>
                        </ul>
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Now that you have given your document a title, author and date, you can print this information on the document with the <b>\maketitle</b> command. This should be included in the <b>body</b> of the document at the place you want the
                    title to be printed.
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <ul>
                        <li>\begin{document}</li>
                        <li>\maketitle</li>

                        </li>
                        <li>\end{document}</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Adding_comments">
            <header>

            <article>
                <p>
                    As with any code you are writing, it can often be useful to include comments. Comments are pieces of text you can include in the document which will not be printed, and will not affect the document in any way. They are useful for organizing your work,
                    taking notes, or commenting out lines/sections when debugging. To make a comment in LaTeX, simply write a % symbol at the beginning of the line as shown below:
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <ul>
                        <li>\begin{document}</li>
                        <li>\maketitle <br></li>
                        <li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>We have now added a title, author and date to our first \LaTeX{} document!</li>
                                <li>% This line here is a comment. It will not be printed in the document.</li>
                            </ul>
